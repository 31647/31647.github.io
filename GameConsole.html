    <h1>Game console</h1>
    <p>The game console that I have is a ps4. This is my personal favorite game console. Although it was expensive when it came out it was a great deal. This game console had more apps than the ps3. In most stores the price for a ps4 is high to $500-$600. In other stores the price of this game console can range from $100-$400. It is still a good price if you were just done using a ps3 and if your interested in a fancier game console. The game that I only play for my game console is just Call of duty black ops 3.</p>
